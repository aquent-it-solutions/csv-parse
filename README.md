# CSV-parse

CSV-parse is a tool to help people parse CSV files into JSON objects and vice versa.  Use of the papaparse library is made, so features like auto-delimiter detection and many more cool things can be easily configured.  This is a work in progress so please create new issues as you may see them arise.

## Installation

I don't have an npm module up yet so in the meantime, just clone this project.
